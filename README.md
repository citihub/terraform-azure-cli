# Terraform, Azure CLI and Databricks CLI Docker image
This repo is a fork from [Zenika/terraform-azure-cli](https://github.com/zenika/terraform-azure-cli) with Databricks CLI, jq and wget added to the image.

## üì¶ Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links
Available image tags can be found on the Docker Hub registry: [citihub/terraform-azure-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/citihub/terraform-azure-cli/tags)

The following image tag strategy is applied:
* `citihub/terraform-azure-cli:latest` - build from master
  * Included CLI versions can be found in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/citihub/terraform-azure-cli/blob/master/Dockerfile)
* `citihub/terraform-azure-cli:release-S.T_terraform-UU.VV.WW_azcli-XX.YY.ZZ_databricks-AA.BB.CC` - build from releases
  * `release-S.T` is the release tag
  * `terraform-UU.VV.WWW` is the included Terraform CLI version
  * `azcli-XX.YY.ZZ` is the included Azure CLI version
  * `databricks-AA.BB.ZZ` is the included Databricks CLI version

Please report to the [releases page](https://github.com/citihub/terraform-azure-cli/releases) for the changelogs. Any other tags are not supported.

## Gitlab Terraform

The docker image contains the `gitlab-terraform` shell script. This script is a thin wrapper around the terraform binary. Its main purpose is to serve the Infrastructure as code with Terraform and GitLab
, by extracting some of the standard configuration a user would need to set up to use the Terraform backend on GitLab as well as the Terraform merge request widget.

### How to use it
The wrapper expects three environment variables to be set:

TF_ADDRESS

Should be the backend url. For the GitLab backend it will be something like,
"{GITLAB_API_URL}/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/terraform/state/{STATE_NAME}"

- {GITLAB_API_URL} is the URL of your GitLab API.

- {PROJECT_ID} is the id of the project you're using as your infrastructure as code.

- {STATE_NAME} can be arbitrarily defined to the Terraform state name one wants to create.

TF_USERNAME

Is your user login name, which must have maintainer access. If this is unset, it will default to the value of GITLAB_USER_LOGIN which is the username that triggered the build.

TF_PASSWORD

An access token created for the above maintainer with the api scope. If this is unset, it will default to the value of CI_JOB_TOKEN and override the TF_USERNAME to match.


### Optional environment variables

TF_CACERTS

A directory with CA certificates to added to the docker image. The contents of the TF_CACERTS directory are copied to the `/usr/local/shared/ca-certificates` directory in the running container and `/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates` is run to update the container CA certificates.

TF_HTTP_SKIP_CERT_VERIFY

Whether to skip TLS verification. Possible values are true or false. Defaults to false.

### HTTP backend
Terraform HTTP backend environment variables are also implemented - see [Terraform http backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/http.html)

## üí°Motivation
The goal is to create a **minimalist** and **lightweight** image with these tools in order to reduce network and storage impact.

This image gives you the flexibility to be used for development or as a base image as you see fits.

This image uses a non-root user with a UID and GID of 1001 to conform with docker security best practices.

## üöÄ Usage

### Launch the CLI
Simply launch the container and use the CLI as you would on any other platform, for instance using the latest image:

```bash
docker container run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace citihub/terraform-azure-cli:latest
```

> The `--rm` flag will completely destroy the container and its data on exit.

### Build the image
You can build the image locally directly from the Dockerfile, using the build script.

It will :
* Lint the Dockerfile with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint);
* Build and tag the image `citihub/terraform-azure-cli:dev`;
* Execute [container structure tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) on the image.

```bash
# launch build script
./dev-build.sh
```

Optionally, it is possible to choose the tools desired versions using [Docker builds arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) :

```bash
# Set tools desired versions
AZURE_CLI_VERSION=2.19.1
TERRAFORM_VERSION=0.14.6
DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION=0.14.6

# launch the build script with parameters
./dev-build.sh $AZURE_CLI_VERSION $TERRAFORM_VERSION $DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION
```
