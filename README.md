## üöÄ Usage

### Launch the CLI
Simply launch the container and use the CLI as you would on any other platform, for instance using the latest image:

```bash
docker container run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace citihub/terraform-azure-cli:latest
```

> The `--rm` flag will completely destroy the container and its data on exit.

### Build the image
You can build the image locally directly from the Dockerfile, using the build script.

It will :
* Lint the Dockerfile with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint);
* Build and tag the image `citihub/terraform-azure-cli:dev`;
* Execute [container structure tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) on the image.

```bash
# launch build script
./dev-build.sh
```

Optionally, it is possible to choose the tools desired versions using [Docker builds arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) :

```bash
# Set tools desired versions
AZURE_CLI_VERSION=2.19.1
TERRAFORM_VERSION=0.14.6
DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION=0.14.6

# launch the build script with parameters
./dev-build.sh $AZURE_CLI_VERSION $TERRAFORM_VERSION $DATABRICKS_CLI_VERSION
```
